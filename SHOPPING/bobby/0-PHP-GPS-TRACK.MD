## PHP MYSQL GPS TRACKING SYSTEM
https://code-boxx.com/gps-tracking-system-php-javascript/

## NOTES
1) Create a database and import `1-database.sql`.
2) Change the database settings in `2-lib-track.php` to your own.
3) Access `4a-track.html` for the client/rider tracking page, and `4b-admin.html` for the demo admin page.
4) Take extra note that GPS geolocation requires `https://` to work properly. `http://localhost` is an exception for testing.
